2. To ensure the code is able to run correctly, install all the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file. 
to do so use: 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your terminal. Once you have done this, use these commands to finish setting up the project: 
python manage.py migrate, python manage.py createsuperuser, and once you've created your super user, python manage.py runserver

3. If you are working with a team, make sure to use Git/Github to ensure source control.
