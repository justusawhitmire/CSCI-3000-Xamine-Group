---Appointment Scheduling Defect--

Issue: Receptionists able to schedule an appointment at a time that had already past if the date was set to the current date,
       EX: Current Time: 11/20/20 03:15 pm, Appointment time: 11/20/20 02:15 pm, Still able to schedule even though the appointment time has passed
Resolution: Added a now variable to schedule branch in views.py using  now = datetime.datetime.now() that establishes the current time, created if branch that
            compares the appointment time to now variable and returns an error message if appointment time is set earlier than current time
Result: Receptionists must now schedule the appointment and reminder for a time in the future, otherwise they receive an error message and have to reschedule the 
        appointment

---Email Reminder Defect---

Issue: Reminder email containing scheduled time for patient was printing a time that was 5 hours after the actual appointment
Resolution: Created a fixed time variable in tasks.py on line 91: appt = order.appointment - timedelta(hours=5), updated the calls for appointment data in message
            of reminder data: original=order.appointment.strftime("%A") updated=appt.strftime("%A")
Result: Email displays the exact scheduled day, date, and time of the appointment
